# Marks
Marks is a canonical format for text documents. This document specifies
the syntax of `marks' documents using regular expressions, a context-free
grammar, and a handful of special cases.

## Special Cases
No line may be more than 78 printed characters wide, and words in chunks
that contain multiple-line word sequences must occur on the earliest line
in which they can fit. For example, the following is invalid because `tom'
could still fit in the first line without going over the character limit:
	| hi there
	| tom

A handful of things need to be lined up:
	- All the names in a named list must be the same width. Append
	  additional underscores to fatten smaller words.
	- The `align' token is two spaces for bulleted lists, and
	  `namewidth+1' spaces for named lists

Indentation is done by prefixing lines with one or more tab characters. It's
difficult to handle this in the rules so we use the imaginary INDENT and
UNDENT tokens. The regular expressions in the rules will ignore leading tabs
and pretend that all lines actually begin right after the final leading tab.

INDENT is generated whenever we encounter a section where the indentation
increases, and UNDENT where it decreases. If the depth changes by more than
one level, then more than one token will be generated.

Annotation words must always be followed by a word or a word sequence in
the same paragraph but not necessary in the same line.

Quoted words take the form: ``word'', except that quotations may be nested
and both of the quotations characters may be escaped with `\\'. Using a
backslash followed by any character besides `[\\\`\']' is an error.

The brackets used to make word-sequences must match in a given chunk.

## Grammar
| empty → /^$/
| align → /^ +/
| space → / /
| eol   → /$/

| bullet → /^-/
| name   → /^_{bword}_+/
| hdr    → /^#+/
| banno  → /^::[A-Z]+::/
| lit    → /^\|( .*[^\t ])?$/

| seq   → /"{"/
| eseq  → /"}"/
| anno  → /:[A-Z]+:/
| bword → /[^ \t\n`"{}\[\]]*[^ \t\n`"{}\[\].,:;!?]/
| qword → {Special Case}
| ref   → /"["{bword}"]"/
| word  → /{bword}|{qword}|{ref}|{anno}/
| pword → /[.,:;!?]/

| Word → word | word pword | seq | eseq
| ParaLine → Word space ParaLine
|          | Word eol

| Hdr → hdr space ParaLine
| Para → ParaLine Para |
| Anno → banno space ParaLine
| Blist → bullet space ParaLine Blist_
| Blist_ → align ParaLine Blist_ |
| Nlist → name space ParaLine Nlist_
| Nlist_ → align space ParaLine Nlist_ |
| Lit → Lit lit | lit
| Chunk → Nlist | Blist | Para | Lit | Anno

| NestSect → Chunk INDENT NestSect_ UNDENT
|          | Chunk empty
|          | Chunk EOF
| NestSect_ → NestSect_ NestSect | NestSect
| Sect → Hdr | NestSect | Hdr EOF
| Marks → Marks Sect |

# Marks
This is a markup system like Markdown or RestructuredText, but with
an emphasis on having extremely simple syntax and implementation.
This file is a valid input for marks.

## Output Format
Marks produces troff output, and no other back-end will ever be
considered.  Troff is simple, general, and easy to generate, and it can
be used to produces ASCII, html, and postscript.  Troff has various
marco packages, but I haven't finished considering if I can support
them cleanly.

## Basic Syntax
The syntax is designed so that the implementation only needs to
examine one line at a time, and lines have a maximum width of 78 bytes.
There are four types of syntax besides straight up text: Indentation
(with tabs), various line prefixes, simple thingy markup within a line,
and macro annotations.

## Macros and Extension
| :MACRO: Input, input, input
|
| :MACRO: Input, input, input
| 	Input, input
| 	Input, input
| Normal text.

| This is a line :MACRO:, but we don't have pizza!  :(

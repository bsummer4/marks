# marks
This contains the specification for the `marks' language (as defined in
`SPEC'), and a set of translators from the `marks' language to various
other markup languages.

## TODO
:TODO: Support utf8 better
	:TODO: multicol chars
		Some unicode chars fill two or even zero columns. The
		current code assumes they all fill exactly one.

:TODO: Reject unprintable characters (use `isprint(3)').
:TODO: Break up words in `words'.
:TODO: Handled `inline-quoted-text'.
:TODO: Handle macro syntax
:TODO: More-correct Output.
	Why are continuation lines and indented lines aligned in the
	output?

:TODO: Annotation Separation
	Annotation without sub-chunks must not be separated from other
	annotations, but must be separated from other things.

:TODO: `NLIST' in `input()':
	It doesn't work with unicode items in named lists.

:TODO: `ANNO' in `input()':
	It's a stub.

:TODO: Do comprehensive validation in `recognize()'.

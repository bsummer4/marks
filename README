# Marks
This is a markup system like Markdown or RestructuredText, but with
an emphasis on having extremely simple syntax and implementation.
This file is a valid input for marks.

## Output Format
Marks produces troff code.  Troff is simple, general, and easy to
generate, and it can be used to produces ASCII, html, and postscript.
Troff has various marco packages, but I haven't finished considering if
I can support them cleanly.

## Basic Syntax
The syntax is designed so that the implementation only needs to
examine one line at a time, and lines have a maximum width of 78 bytes.
There are four types of syntax besides straight up text:

- Indentation (with tabs)
- Various line prefixes
- Simple word annotations within a line
- Macro annotations.

## Macros
| :MACRO: Input, input, input

| :MACRO: Input, input, input
| 	Input, input
| 	Input, input
| Normal text.

| This is a line :MACRO:.

| This is a word *annotation*.  I have yet to decide what characters are
| valid for annotations.  Annotations must be around a single word.  They
| may not span multiple words or multiple lines.  You can annotates more
| than one word with *{phrase annotations}*.  Curly braces have no special
| meaning when they are not directly next to an annotation characer.  Both
| braces must match and be in the same paragraph.  %{*{Phrase annotations}*
| (yay)}% can be nested.  Annotations are associated with a macro and
| handled almost the same way as line annotations.

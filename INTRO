# `marks' Introduction
## Overview
`marks' is a {light-weight markup language} like Markdown or
RestructuredText. Unlike most of these languages, which are designed
primarily for generating HTML and/or typesetting books, `marks' is meant to
be produced and consumed primarly as plain text. This document is a valid
`marks' document.

Here are some goals for the format:
	- {Simplicity}: The syntax should only be a handful of well
	  thought-out features, and it should not be open for extension.
	  There should be some non-intrusive mechanism for allowing domain
	  concepts.
	- {Canonical Representation}: There should be a single valid
	  representation for all documents. This way all documents look
	  the same regardless of who (or what program) created them. One
	  advantage of this is that it makes it possible to write simple
	  programs that do fine-grained transformations without having to
	  constantly edit their output.
	- {Useful}: I want to keep everything in `marks' so it can't be too
	  annoying or too limited.

The following programs are planned:
	- `marks': Validate or canonicalize a `marks' documents.
	- `marks2': Generate output in various formats. Uses a simple
	  DSL to specify how to generate each output format.
		At least `HTML', `troff', `espeak', and `markdown'
		should be included. The DSL also lets you specify how
		to handle macros.

## Syntax
Since `marks' defines a canonical representation, the syntax is very
rigid. In general, `marks' documents contain text which is formatted into
headers and possibly-indented chunks. Chunks may be: paragraphs, named
lists, bulleted lists, sections of literal text, and section annotations.

For examples, see all the documents in this directory. For a full
description see [SPEC].

:TODO: Loose description of all the syntax
	{References} are {basic words} enclosed in square brackets. These
	are meant to be used for referencing external documents or
	internal sections, but the semantics are unspecified. Here are
	some examples of references:
		- [hi]
		- [Fig.1]
		- [google.com]
		- [/bin/sh]
		- [http://www.google.com]

	In this document I use footnotes like this:
		| Some not-quite-true statement [1].
		|
		| ...
		|
		| ::NOTE:: 1
		| 	A clarification

	{Quoted text} is Free-form text wrapped in back-quote/single-quote
	pairs. Quotations may be nested and the delimiters must
	match. Quoted sections may not span multiple lines. Here are
	some examples of quoted text words:
		- `quoted word'.
		- The single-quote character `('')' can be included
		  by doubling.
		- `  arbitrary   spacing  is...     fine'.

	{Word Sequences}, generally, are lines containing multiple words
	separated by a single space. Some forms (paragraphs and lists for
	example) define ways for word sequences to span multiple lines,
	but we'll ignore that for now. Word sequences may be nested by
	wrapping sequences of words inside curly-brackets.

	To make English text look OK, there is a special-case for
	punctuation characters. For example, if you follow the above
	rules, sentences ending with links would need to look like this:
		| To find stuff, go to [http://www.google.com] .

	Since the link and the period are two distinct words, they need
	to be separated be a space. This is unacceptably cumbersome,
	so we add a spacial-case where a words that are built entierly
	from whitespace characters are not proceded by whitespace.

	{Word Annotations} consist of an annotation and a word annotations
	look like this: `:ANNO:', and they modify the next word in a word
	sequence in some unspecified way. These are indented to allow
	bits of semantic information to be included in an ad-hoc way
	without bloating `marks' itself. Here are a couple of examples:
		| .Steve. Hi there :FRIEND: Fred, how life?
		| .Fred.. Oh, it's going alright.
		| .Steve. Cool, well I've got to go talk to :FRIEND: Sally

		| - :TODO: {Eat some tuna}
		| - :TODO: {Eat some carrots}

	h ### Spacing
	All lines must contain fewer than 80 {printed characters}. Not all
	characters fill only a single {printed character.} For example,
	tabs are 8 {printed characters} [1], and some unicode characters
	also are wider than normal characters. All spacing characters
	besides newline, tab, and space are banned. Tabs may only be used
	for indentation and inside quoted text. Spaces must never occur
	in groups of two or more except when they are being used to align
	lists. Furthermore, no line may ever end with a tab or a space.

	::NOTE:: 1
		Technically tabs fill to the next multiple of 8
		characters, but tabs are only allowed at the beginning
		of lines, so it's irrelavant.

	h ### Section Headers

	- Sections headers have one or more `#' characters at the
	  beginning of a line, followed by a single space and one or
	  more words.
	- A single hash (`#') indicates a top-level header and headers
	  with more hashes indicate subheaders.
	- Headers may not {jump} down levels, each sub-header must be
	  preceded by a header of the next-highest level.
	- Headers may not be included in indented sections.

	h ### Paragraphs
	Paragraphs are {word sequences} that span mulitple lines. You are
	reading a paragraph. Paragraphs may be indented using tabs, but
	never contain leading spaces. Adjacent paragraphs are separated
	by a single empty line. Each lines in a paragraph must use as
	much horizontal space as possible.

	h ### Section Annotaions
	These are similar to {Word Annotations} except they happen
	in-between paragraphs and lists. Anything indented {within}
	a {section annotation} is considered to be part of it. Here is
	an example:
		| ::TODO:: Write an example
		| 	There should be an example to show what section
		| 	annotations look like... Write one.

This is a paragraph
this is more of there paragraph.  This line continues
from above, the location of newlines doesn't affect the output.

this is how \\
you make paragraphs \\
with explicit newlines

01. This is a list
02. The specific numbers matter
10. All the '.'s must line up
    A single list item may span multiple lines.
    How this is indented is significant.  All lines must line up with the
    first line, only spaces may be used for this type of indentation.

- This is an unordered list
- Same rules as above
  For items with multiple lines

- In unordered lists, you can add explicit newlines \\
  like you can in normal paragraphs.

- Lists can be nested with tabs
	1. Like this
		- Hi
	2. This is awesome!

- Valid characters to start an unordered list are:
	+ -
	+ %
	+ @
	+ +

- Valid numbers for ordered lists are
	+ Decimal numbers
	+ lower case characters
	+ Upper case characters

- Every ordered sequence must use exatly one of these patterns.

Literal quotations look like this:

| This is plaintext
|
| Just about anything goes in this context!
|
| This is the only context where you can have whitespace at the end of a
| line.  There must always be at least one space after the '|'.  Spaces
| after the first are considered to be
| part of the
| text.
|
| The 80 character limit still applies.  There is no way to
| include quoted text with long lines.

To extending the syntax, copy and modify the source code to add new
contexts.  They should work syntactically exactly like the above ones.
There are no "hooks" into the system.  Don't be a wanker, just modify
the code.  Some possible extensions.

- Use $\Sigma$ for math expressions
- Use {<word type="crass"><prefix>bull</prefix><suffix>shit</suffix></word>}
  to mix output literals in the input code.  For example:

  | - Some embeded latex code.  This is probably a good idea when:
  |   {\begin{math}
  |    \forall x \in \mathbb{R}, x = x + 3
  |    \end{math}}

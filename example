I like pretty paragraphs.
They are pretty pretty.

Awesomeness is awesome.

.1. Maybe numbered lists
.2. could look like
.3. this.

The _'s proceding spaces are just temporary hacks to get the current
version to accept it.

.0001. A good rule I've been folowing is that different syntax has to be
_      distinguishable by the first character in the line.  Since lines
_      starting with numbers are perfectly valid, markdown syntax is
_      a problem:

	| 1. One
	| 2. Two
	|
	| This is where the number
	| 1 is used.

.0002. However, lines \\ starting with a . are pretty rare, and it still
_      looks fair.
